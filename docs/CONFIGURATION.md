> **Post-2026-05-06** — read [`../../unified-trading-pm/codex/POST_PLAN_REALITY_2026_05_06.md`](../../unified-trading-pm/codex/POST_PLAN_REALITY_2026_05_06.md) before code/doc changes informed by this doc. The post-plan-reality doc summarizes the 10 cross-cutting principles codified in workspace `CLAUDE.md` (live=batch, no double SSOT, three-category empty-output decision A/B/C, cluster validation MANDATORY at `record_captured`, `available_at` per-row write-time, prediction lifecycle, temporary state must have named successor, per-VM shard isolation, multi-axis shard-vs-display distinction) plus the active plans (`writegate_honest_coverage_endtoend_2026_05_06.md`, `predictions_canonical_question_group_polymarket_migration_2026_05_06.md`, `data_status_multi_axis_shard_propagation_2026_05_06.md`). If this doc disagrees with the active plans, the plans win. Flag conflicts to user — don't decide unilaterally.
